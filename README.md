### `npx fka`


Hello, this is **Izra Bereket**

I'm a passionate **software developer** living in the **United States**, working for [Abbott]([https://www.abbott.com]) as a **SDE/DevOps Engineer**.
I love learning more about the world of technology, I like to read a lot as well.
I love **Python**.

> P.S. To read this intro on terminal, just run `npx fka`. But why? -- why not? 🤷🏻‍♂️

Projects on the way very soon :)
